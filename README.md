# vim-monokai-tasty.vim

Inspired by Sublime Text's interpretation of monokai, this colour scheme makes use of cterm color numbers to support VIM running on a wide range of systems.
It focuses mostly on Javascript highlighting, although there are bindings for the standard VIM highlights which will map for most languages.

This colour scheme makes use of and has a dependency on [`vim/pangloss`](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript), a VIM syntax file for javascript.
